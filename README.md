# VRecorder
A barebones JavaScript audio recorder using the mediaStream recording API

This is a JavaScript library for recording audio in the browser, with compatibility with browsers supporting the mediaStream recording API (e.g. Chrome and Firefox etc).
The code is simplified and adapted from the excellent example on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API/Using_the_MediaStream_Recording_API

Feel free to modify it in any way.
